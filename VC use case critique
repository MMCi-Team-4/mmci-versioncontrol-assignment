Description of Use Case
Consent2Share is a web-based application to give patients the ability to consent to share their health information with particular health care providers. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sponsored the project to demonstrate Consent2Share’s capability and has made the documentation and software available for free on GitHub. The focus is towards giving patients with sensitive behavioral health data the ability to decide upon and electronically consent to sharing their data with other health professionals that conforms to the requirements put forth in 42 CFR Part 2 and FHIR. The forms can integrate within the existing health information exchange (HIE) systems allowing specific informing to be excluded from the record being sent to a health professional (i.e. redaction of substance abuse treatment). 

Consent2Share uses GitHub (link: https://github.com/bhits/consent2share) as a repository for the software code for all aspects of the program: interfaces, documentation segmentation services, FHIR integration service, etc. Additionally, it stores the user guides, development and deployment guides. It is built upon a microservices architecture so each microservice is presented separately with GitHub by domain. On the main page there is a link to a Release page that delineates what is included in each version and due to GitHub’s capability, it shows exactly who and when it was released. Consent2Share uses GitHub for version control for the software code changes and changes to any of the supporting documents.
